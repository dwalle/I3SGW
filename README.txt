This program is the Interactive Individual Identification System that will assist someone in identifying a gray whale, based on a photograph of it's tail. This is an open source program based on: http://www.reijns.com/i3s/index.html

I got involved in this project through the Biology Department at my university. They would regularly take photos of Gray Whales and try to match the pattern on the tails by hand. When they heard of this program, they wanted a programmer to make it applicable to Gray Whales. As such, I was available to assist them in my Senior year, making this my capstone project. 

There is a demo video of the application here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51WpFwBWZrw
